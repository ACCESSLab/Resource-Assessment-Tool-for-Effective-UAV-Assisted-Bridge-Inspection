# Resource-Assessment-Tool-for-Effective-UAV-Assisted-Bridge-Inspection

In this study, a resource estimation tool that can be used to estimate the resources required for UAS-assisted bridge inspections is developed. The tool can aid inspectors in determining the estimated flight time and resources required for using a specific UAS and operator during inspection of a specific bridge. The tool supports the development of optimal flight paths based on the structural geometry and positioning of structural elements of a bridge, establishes a range of recommended flight speeds for conducting reliable UAS-assisted bridge inspections based on the skill level(s) of the pilot(s) involved in the conduct of inspections, and establishes a recommended range of wind speed and the corresponding standoff clearance information for safely conducting the UAS- assisted bridge inspections. The tool also provides an estimated number of batteries required to allow the estimated required flight time.

Flight Speed Range Based on Pilotâ€™s Skill Level

Basic		      1.00 - 1.75		mph
Intermediate	1.75 - 2.30		mph
Professional	2.30 - 3.00		mph

Tool Outputs:

The tool provides the estimation of the flights in minutes across vertical, horizontal, longitudinal, isolated and per span.

Time for Total Vertical Flights	    (min)
Time for Total Horizontal Flights   (min)
Time for Total Longitudinal Flights (min)
Time for Total Isolated Flights	    (min)

Flight Time Per Span (min)

Based on the flight time per battery, battery swap time and pilot skill level, the tool provides the estimate of the total inspection time and the number of batteries that would be required to complete the whole data collection process for the bridge under inspection.
